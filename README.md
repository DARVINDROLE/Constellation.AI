🌌 Constellation.AI
Project Title: Galaxy Star Plot & Constellation Mapping
Constellation.AI is an interactive star visualization platform that empowers users to explore celestial constellations in a fully interactive, immersive way. Developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, this full-stack project visualizes over 150 constellations and known exoplanets, blending real astronomical data with intuitive front-end experiences.

🚀 Why Constellation.AI?
Constellations are more than just patterns in the sky — they represent humanity’s connection to the universe. However, for many, the night sky is just a mass of stars with little meaning. Constellation.AI bridges that gap using real data visualizations and dynamic educational content to help anyone, anywhere, understand and engage with our galaxy.

From school students to stargazing enthusiasts, our tool makes it easy to:

Explore real-time star positions

Learn about officially recognized constellations

Discover exoplanets with contextual details

✨ Key Features

🧬 How It Works
Constellation Plot Engine
Uses Plotly.js to render a dynamic star map from celestial coordinates (RA & DEC).

Star Cluster Grouping
Stars are grouped into their respective constellations (IAU recognized or custom clusters).

Exoplanet Details
Cards display known exoplanets along with classification, size, and orbital data.

Responsive Mobile View
Dedicated mobile UI displays constellations, planets, and explanations in a scrollable format.
