# 🌌 Constellation.AI

### Project Title: Galaxy Star Plot & Constellation Mapping

**Constellation.AI** is an interactive star visualization platform that empowers users to explore celestial constellations in a fully immersive way. Developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024**, this full-stack project visualizes over 150 constellations and known exoplanets, blending real astronomical data with an intuitive frontend experience.

## 🚀 Why Constellation.AI?

Constellations are more than just patterns in the sky — they represent humanity’s connection to the universe. However, for many, the night sky is just a mass of stars with little meaning. **Constellation.AI** bridges that gap using real data visualizations and educational content to help anyone, anywhere, engage with our galaxy.

**With Constellation.AI, users can:**
- Explore real-time star positions
- Learn about officially recognized constellations
- Discover exoplanets with contextual details
